In order to get all the data for a ninja (both the current belt and past belts) we need to do two seperate calls.

Two things need to be done:
    -ninjaData: One call will need to get all the data for a ninja (notes, current belt/activity, etc).
    -impactData: The second call will get all the activities in a belt up to the ninja's current belt.
    (maybe more, depends on what jesse wants)

After the two calls are done, you will need to then parse them. A new object/array (parsedData) will be made from ninjaData
and impactData. This new object, parsedData, will match the notes from ninjaData to the activities in impactData.

The component that will create parsedData will also need to be able to output a "blank" file for the sensei page.
The sensei page does not need any ninja data, so we dont need to match a ninjaData to an impactData, we just need the impactData.
